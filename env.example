# Copy this file to ".env" on your VPS:
#   cp env.example .env
# Then edit values as needed.

# Host bind IP for published ports
# - Recommended for VPS: keep as 127.0.0.1 so DB/Redis/API are NOT exposed publicly.
# - Only set 0.0.0.0 if you intentionally need remote access and you know what you're doing.

# Redis Configuration
# If you set this, docker-compose will start Redis with requirepass and backend will connect using it.

# Frontend Configuration
# IMPORTANT on VPS:
# - Keep this DIFFERENT from 80 and 443 (they are used by the main reverse proxy).
# - 8080 is a safe default and is only bound to 127.0.0.1 thanks to BIND_IP above.
FRONTEND_PORT=8080
# If empty, frontend will use /api and nginx in the frontend container will proxy to backend.
